Watcher is a content agregator built in node, originally to track a large number of webcomics,
	and to facilitate the reading of them in a seamless (no latency) fassion. It is built
	to be deployed on a raspberry PI inside a secure network. As such there is no authentication.

External dependencies: imagemagick
On some system it might also be usefull to install chromium-browser using the local package manager
	in that case watcher expects it to be found at /usr/bin/chromium-browser

Uses the WATCHER_LOCATION enviroment variable to decide where to store files
