Watcher is a content agregator built in node, originally to track a large number of webcomics,
	and to facilitate the reading of them in a seamless (no latency) fassion. It is built
	to be deployed on a raspberry PI inside a secure network. As such there is no authentication
	and very little care is taken to readuce the amount of traffic, favoring simplicity instead

External dependencies: Sqlite3, imagemagick

Uses the WATCHER_LOCATION enviroment variable to decide where to store files
