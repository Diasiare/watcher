loop through a set of sites and check for changes
	if there are changes, download them to some specified folder.

	This includes webcomics, horriblesubs and bato / manga

	what is needed to do this, a download method, a way to extract a link for that method, a way to check for updates. 

	Also whenver an update is downloaded, should push some kind of notification to something (rainmeter or windows)

	Should have the capacity to catch up if a few updates are missed

	Structure, provide, in some settings file, a gatherer that takes the last known adress and an ordered array of objects to download (probbabbly urls), feed them to some downloader and we are good.
